# CocoaNec Antenna

During one of the weekly Thursday nets of the Burnaby Amateur Radio 
club (2000 pst on 145.350 MHz -600) the discussion turned to fractal
antennas, and I was inspired to attempt to create a model in 
cocoaNEC, a macOS application for modeling antennas 
(http://www.w7ay.net/site/Applications/cocoaNEC/). 

In my experience, most people use the spreadsheet functionality to 
create the antenna models, laboriously entering the x, y and z 
positions of each segment endpoint of their antennas. For simple
antennas, a dipole antenna, this is fine, but when your antenna ideas
get a bit complicated this task becomes onourous.

cocoaNec 2.0 includes, in addition to the spreadsheet functionality, 
a programming method to describe antennas using a scripting language
called NC. NC is similar enough to C that it will be usable by anyone 
who has some rudimentary programming experience. 

In addition to being easier to create antennas in NC than it is 
in the spreadsheet, it is possible to optimize antennas by selecting
a parameter, or many parameters of the antenna 

Unfortunately there are some behaviours of NC that I don't like

- variables can only be defined at the begining of functions
- variables cannot be assigned in the definition
- some functions do not behave like functions, see runModel for example
- you are limited to one module, or source file for your script
- hard to reuse code you've written before, you must cut and paste 

That said, I have been able to quickly create models of antennas and
then optimize the designs before I attempt to build them.

## Getting Started

The '.nc' files in this repository can be loaded and executed with a 
free macOS application called cocoaNEC, which is an application used
for desiging and modeling antennas. You can download it from

http://www.w7ay.net/site/Applications/cocoaNEC/

### Prerequisites

The cocoaNEC 2.0 application. And a macOS computer.


## Built With

* [cocoaNEC 2.0](http://www.w7ay.net/site/Applications/cocoaNEC/Contents/Downloads.html) - The antenna design software

## Files:

BoringFractal.nc - my first attempt, making sure NC allows recursion

Dipole.nc        - the antenna to beat

DragonCurve.nc   - a fractal generated by folding

KochFractal.nc   - generated by replacing the center of a line with a triangle
